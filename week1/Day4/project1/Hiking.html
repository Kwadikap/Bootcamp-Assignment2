        Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Myrdalsjökull and is
        surrounded by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during
        summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding
        to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way
        to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!
