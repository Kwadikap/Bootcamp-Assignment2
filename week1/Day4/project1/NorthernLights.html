        THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis, or northern lights, begin high in the

        The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near
        Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more accesible places if you'd like
        to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this
        celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55°
        and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.

        In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long
        winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes
        in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar
        particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I
        suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant
        temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location
        here, or by using a sky guide app.
